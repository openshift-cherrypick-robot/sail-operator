# This file defines all the Istio versions supported by this operator.

# Since you can't install multiple versions of the same CRD, only one of the
# versions specified below can be the source of the CRDs. Because CRDs are
# typically backwards-compatible, the following field should point to the
# most recent version.
crdSourceVersion: v1.22.1
# The list of versions to support. Each item specifies the name of the version,
# the Git repository and commit hash for retrieving the profiles, and
# a list of URLs for retrieving the charts.
